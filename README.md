#Bridge
##Project 2 - SEI
###Full Stack CRUD Application
---
Welcome to my App!  

"BRIDGE" is an interactive web application that connects students with local networking events related to their interests. Students can add and edit their own events and share with their inner circle - classmates.

BRIDGE will help students stay connected, share, and communicate with each other on a dedicated platform regarding similar events of interest.
